## Revenue Computation

This project contains a Python application to compute various revenue metrics from a dataset of customer orders and a set of tests to verify the functionality.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── main.py
├── test.py
└── orders.csv
```

- **main.py**: Main Python script containing the logic for computing revenue metrics.
- **test.py**: Test script containing unit tests for the application.
- **orders.csv**: Sample dataset file containing customer orders.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed on your system.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install pandas
   ```

## How to Run the Application

1. **Run the main script**:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

   This command will read data from `orders.csv` and compute the required revenue metrics.

2. **Output**:

   The application will print the following to the console:
   - Monthly Revenue
   - Product Revenue
   - Customer Revenue
   - Top 10 Customers by Revenue

## How to Run the Tests

1. **Run the test script**:

   ```sh
   python test.py
   ```

   This command will run the unit tests to verify the correctness of the revenue computation functions.

2. **Output**:

   The test results will be printed to the console, showing the outcome of each test case.

## Explanation of the Code

### Main Script (`main.py`)

This script reads the data from `orders.csv` and computes various revenue metrics:

- **Monthly Revenue**: Total revenue generated by the online store for each month.
- **Product Revenue**: Total revenue generated by each product.
- **Customer Revenue**: Total revenue generated by each customer.
- **Top 10 Customers**: Identifies the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

### Test Script (`test.py`)

This script contains unit tests to verify the functionality of the main script:

- **Test Monthly Revenue**: Verifies the correctness of monthly revenue computation.
- **Test Product Revenue**: Verifies the correctness of product revenue computation.
- **Test Customer Revenue**: Verifies the correctness of customer revenue computation.
- **Test Top 10 Customers**: Verifies the correctness of identifying the top 10 customers by revenue.

## Dependencies

- pandas

Install the dependencies using:

```sh
pip install pandas
```

## Conclusion

This setup provides a straightforward way to compute and verify revenue metrics from a dataset of customer orders. Follow the instructions above to run the application and the tests.
